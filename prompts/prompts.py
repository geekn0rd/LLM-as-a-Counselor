    help the help-seeker articulate the issues that they face. Openended questions are best,and closed questions can be used to
    get specific information.

    rephrasing of the help-seeker’s statements that could help
    them see their situation more clearly.
    - Reflection of Feelings: Articulate and describe the helpseeker’s feelings.
    - Self-disclosure: Divulge similar experiences that you have
    had or emotions that you share with the help-seeker to express
    your empathy.
    - Affirmation and Reassurance: Affirm the helpseeker’s
    strengths, motivation, and capabilities and provide reassurance and encouragement.
    - Providing Suggestions: Provide suggestions about how to
    change, but be careful to not overstep and tell them what to
    do.
    - Information: Provide useful information to the help-seeker,
    for example with data, facts, opinions, resources, or by answering questions.
    - Others: Exchange pleasantries and use other support strategies that do not fall into the above categories.
