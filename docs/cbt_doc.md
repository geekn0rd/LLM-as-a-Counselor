# Cognitive Behavior Therapy (CBT) Technique

## 1. Overview

CBT is a psychological therapeutic approach that explores cognitive factors in mental disorders and suggests effective intervention methods (Beck, 1979). Individuals perceive the world through automatic thoughts stemming from core beliefs. Negative core beliefs often lead to exaggerating or distorting reality, resulting in various cognitive distortions. In the CBT technique, specific treatment strategies are employed to modify and reconstruct cognitive distortions. A detailed definition of each cognitive distortion and the CBT technique are provided below.

## 2. The Types of Cognitive Distortions

The various types of cognitive distortions are as follows. We referred to the types of cognitive distortions and their explanations presented in Sharma et al. (2023).

- **All or nothing thinking**: Divide experiences into categories of either black or white (right or wrong)

- **Overgeneralization**: Make quick judgements about the entire based on a limited part

- **Mental filtering**: Filter out the positive elements and dwell excessively on the negative aspects of a situation
- **Personalization**: Attribute external events to oneself, even when there is no basis for making such a connection
- **Mislabeling**: Use excessively negative language to describe oneself or others

- **Mind-reading**: Make assumptions about the thoughts, feelings, or intentions of others based on one’s perceptions or interpretations

## 3. CBT Strategies

We categorized the types of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) into 20 techniques( Beck, 2020) and proceeded with the research. Brief descriptions for each technique are provided below.

### 3.1 Cognitive Restructuring

- **Guided Discovery**: Core technique involving the therapist guiding the client to explore and understand their thoughts, emotions, and behavior patterns through questioning, exploration, and reflection.

- **Pie Chart Technique:** Used for individuals experiencing excessive self-blame or responsibility, visually representing the contribution of various factors to a specific event or outcome.
- **Alternative Perspective:** Involves asking clients how others might think in similar situations, encouraging consideration of different interpretations.
- **Decatastrophizing:** Aims to reduce the tendency to imagine the worst-case scenario by evaluating the actual likelihood of the feared outcome and preparing for coping strategies.
- **Scaling Questions:** Asks clients to rate their emotions or issues on a scale of 0 to 10, helping in self-awareness and perspective.
- **Socratic Questioning:** In-depth exploration of clients’ thoughts and beliefs, encouraging critical examination and consideration of alternative viewpoints.

- **Thought Experiment:** Encourages clients to imagine how their thoughts might change if a different outcome occurs, promoting flexibility in thinking.
- **Evidence-Based Questioning:** Guides clients to find evidence supporting or contradicting their thoughts, promoting a more evidence-based approach to thinking.
- **Reality Testing:** Explores how well clients’ thoughts align with reality, helping them distinguish between thoughts and actual experiences.
- **Continuum Technique:** Positions clients’ experiences between two extreme situations, encouraging
  a more nuanced evaluation of situations.
- **Changing Rules to Wishes:** Replaces strict rules or arbitrary attitudes with realistic hopes or wishes.
- **Behavior Experiment:** Involves trying out new behaviors in specific situations to challenge and modify negative beliefs.

### 3.2 Behavioral Activation

Depression and similar conditions often lead to a decrease in activity levels.

- **Behavioral Activation:** is a strategy aimed at increasing activity levels to improve mood.

  use of "I" messages, clear and direct language, and non-verbal communication (tone of voice, gestures,

### 3.4 Exposure
